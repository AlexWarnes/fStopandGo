# f/StopandGo
_Meet your photography goals by planning photoshoots._

[Get started!](https://fstopandgo.herokuapp.com)

## What is f/StopandGo?
I wanted to build something to replace the notepad in my camera bag that's full of disorganized techniques, settings, gear, specific shots, timelapse math, and other notes. **_f/StopandGo_** aims to solve that problem, by motivating people to get out and _use_ thier camera, build on one technique at a time, and not be intimidated by the endless combination of settings.

## How do I Use f/StopandGo?
* **Create an Account.** From the home page, click the "Get Started" button. Provide a username, email, password, and password confirmation. Once validated, you'll be logged in and ready to start planning! 

* **Demo.** Alternatively, you can test drive the app by clicking Demo and logging into the public demo account. To reiterate, **the demo account is public**, so keep that in mind as you create or edit shoots.

* **Dashboard.** From your Dashboard, you can see all your photoshoots and create new shoots by clicking the + button. See below for features I'd like to add to later versions.

* **Photoshoots.** Creating a shoot only requires a title, but you can also add a location, description, and list of gear you'd like to remember (don't forget your batteries and memory!). This is designed to provide a fairly loose structure so you can plan your shoots in a way that's useful for your style. You can always come back to edit or delete your shoots later.
  
* **Menu.** Click the burger icon &#9776; to open the menu. From there you can log out, visit GitHub to see the site's frontend and backend code, delete your account, or simply enjoy clicking the burger to watch it animate from &#9776; to X and back. 
	
## FAQs:
**How do I edit or delete my shoots?**  
Just open a photoshoot from the dashboard and at the bottom of your screen you'll see the Edit and Delete buttons. 
  
**How do I delete my account?**  
About halfway down the **Menu**, you should see the option to delete your account. (**Note:** this option is not available for the demo account.)

## Future Versions and Features
Some ideas for making **_f/StopandGo_** more useful in future versions:

* **Sharing Techniques.** I want to create another page where people can create reference cards for techniques that all users can see, rate, and comment on. Like a recipe on a cooking site. So if you wanted to graduate from "portrait mode" on your phone, to actual portrait photography, you could search in the techniques page to find top rated quick references on how to get started.

* **Saving Techniques.** Related to the first goal, I want users to have the option to save reference cards into their shoots. Lets say you have a photoshoot planned to try some portrait photography techniques with your new lens, and now you can save that helpful Technique Card to your shoot for easy reference. 
  
* **Toolbox.** Sometimes you try something and it's a technique you want to use repeatedly (like the perfect lens, ISO, f-stop, and shutter speed settings for your Milky Way photos). I'd like to have an option for users to create a Toolbox where they can save and quickly reference techniques, settings, or approaches they found useful.
